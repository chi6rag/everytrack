I'm pretty lazy to write a full blown README, so I've just stripped off [my ABOUT page from the Koding Hackathon teams list](https://github.com/sarupbanskota/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/banas/ABOUT.md).

banas is a single-person team comprising [this kid](http://twitter.com/SarupBanskota).

I'm Sarup Banskota, undergrad student and the usual tinkerer. I have my sememster finals going on. Sleeping wouldn't make a great excuse to friends who'd like me to *group study*, so I decided to strike point 8 off my [ideas list](http://sarupbanskota.github.io/ideas.html) instead.


# the_big_idea

If I had a $ for every time a junior/friend/parent asked me how to [contribute to Free Software](http://www.slideshare.net/sarupbanskota/sarup-fossasia-1), [plan a college club event](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Coimbatore_Fedora_Contribution_Camp) or [make the printer work](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=printer+not+working), I would consider sponsoring this hackathon.

All of us have seen some variant of those links, and while I agree the resolute ones will make the best use of it, most folks need things to be presented in a manner they're comfortable with:

> If it's on Wikipedia, it must be right.

I'd like to build a platform where people who want to share can list a bunch of resources in a consistent manner. It's going to be community driven. I want to make it free (as in freedom, beer optional). 

Oh the thought of being able to provide a [sarupbanskota.islearn.in/programming](http://www.irishslang.info/images/funnyimages/Funny-meme-I-changed-my-passwords-to.jpg) that everyone can share around :)

# the_big_plan

With the exams around, I have humble hopes at the moment. Thanks to the hackathon excitement, I'd like to get the project kickstarted and see how it rolls from there.

I'll publish everything on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/sarupbanskota/everytrack), so that's where you go to follow the action.

Cheers!

# tech used so far

The app itself runs Ruby on Rails, there's redcarpet being used for the markdown, devise for auth, and semantic-ui for the front end goodness :)
