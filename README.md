Everytrack is being written keeping FOSS communities in mind. 

# the_big_idea

If I had a $ for every time a junior/friend/parent asked me how to [contribute to Free Software](http://www.slideshare.net/sarupbanskota/sarup-fossasia-1), [plan a college club event](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Coimbatore_Fedora_Contribution_Camp) or [make the printer work](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=printer+not+working), I probably wouldn't have the time to answer them.

All of us have seen some variant of those links, and while I agree the resolute ones make the best use of them, most folks need things to be presented in a manner they're comfortable with:

> If it's on Wikipedia, it must be right.

Everytrack intends to be that platform where people who want to share resources can list a bunch, consistently. It's going to be community driven. It's free software (as in freedom, beer optional). 


# how_it_works

It's pretty simple. If you are into that kind of thing, set up your instance of everytrack ([help!](https://github.com/sarupbanskota/everytrack/wiki/setup)), or simply try out a [demo](http://everytrack-banas.rhcloud.com). Get yourself an account, create a track on a topic you love, and share it around.

Oh the thought of being able to provide a [johndoe.islearn.in/programming](http://www.irishslang.info/images/funnyimages/Funny-meme-I-changed-my-passwords-to.jpg) that everyone can share around :)

# the_big_plan

I'll publish everything on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/sarupbanskota/everytrack), so that's where you go to follow the action.

Cheers!

# tech_so_far

The app itself runs Ruby on Rails, there's redcarpet being used for the markdown, devise for auth, and semantic-ui for the front end goodness :)
